This bombing occurred shortly after a bomb exploded in the Hong Kong Hotel on the same street, Monivong Boulevard, as the Favor Hotel.  Authorities stated that the Favor Hotel had received a threat via telephone claiming that a bomb would go off if the owners did not pay $100,000.  After the attack, the police arrested Chroek Mao, a former soldier who claimed he was working with a group of four other people who had been hired to detonate explosives in Phnom Penh by a former soldier, Ouk Satya.  Satya promised Mao and his group $100,000.  Mao did not give the name of his group, but authorities say Satya was attempting to extort money and incite disorder in the area.",1,1,1,0,"","",1,1,0,3,Bombing/Explosion,"","","","",1,Business,8,Hotel/Resort,Favor Hotel,At least nine people near the explosion,36,Cambodia,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",Unknown,"","","","","","After the attack, the police arrested Chroek Mao, a former soldier who claimed he was working with a group of four other people who had been hired to detonate explosives in Phnom Penh by a former soldier, Ouk Satya.
