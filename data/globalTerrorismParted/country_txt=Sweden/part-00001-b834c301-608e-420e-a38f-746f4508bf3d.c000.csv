The resulting blast killed the bomber and wounded two civilians. The device described as a suicide belt made of pipe bombs, was one of three devices that the bomber had on his person. The second device was described as a pressure cooker, which contained an explosive substance. The third device was contained in the bomber's backpack with screws, wires and an unknown explosive substance. Only the first device detonated. Witnesses said the bomber dropped something, possibly a cell phone, just before the blast, and after he stood up from picking it up, the belt device detonated. It is believed either the device that was dropped or the action of bending over triggered the device. The bomber, identified as Taimour Abdlwahab, 28, was born in Iraq and authorities suspect he had links to Al Qaida in Iraq.
