The bombs, placed by Islamic extremists in backpacks and detonated by cell phones, exploded in the first, fourth and sixth carriages of the train. At least 59 people were killed and many more were injured. The attack was a part of a series of ten bombs that exploded on trains on Madrid's commuter line during the morning rush hour, killing 191 people and wounding more than 1800 others. Police initially accused the Basque separatist group Euskadi ta Askatasuna (ETA) of the attack, which occurred three days before Spain's general election, but Islamic extremists were soon found to be the perpetrators. Abu Hafs al-Masri Brigades, a group said to be associated with Al-Qaida, claimed responsibility for the attack, stating that it was retribution for Spain's cooperation with the United States in the Iraq War. In October 2007, twenty-one suspects were convicted and seven others were acquitted of charges related to the attacks. In July 2008, four of the convictions and one of the acquittals were reversed. Court proceedings indicate that Islamist extremists coordinated by Al-Qaida were responsible for the attacks, but it is unclear if the claim of responsibility from Abu Hafs al-Masri Brigades is valid.",1,1,1,0,"","",1,1,0,3,Bombing/Explosion,"","","","",19,Transportation,100,Train/Train Tracks/Trolley,Civilians,"Indiscriminate civilians on commuter trains in Madrid, Spain.",185,Spain,19,Transportation,100,Train/Train Tracks/Trolley,Commuter Rail System,"Commuter trains in Madrid, Spain",185,Spain,"","","","","","","","",Al-Qaida,"","","","","",Abu Hafs al-Masri Brigades said that the attack was retribution for Spain's cooperation with the United States in the Iraq War.,1,"","",0,"",18,1,4,E-mail,"","","","","","",-9,6,Explosives,12,Remote Trigger,"","","","","","","","","","","","",Twenty two pounds of explosives were located in backpacks and detonated by cell phones.,62,"",0,450,"",0,1,2,Major (likely >= $1 million but < $1 billion),6600000,The Associated Press reported that the attacks cumulatively caused $26.4 million worth of property damage and compensation owed to victims' families.,0,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","This was one of six related attacks (cf. 20040311001; 20040311003-07).

After the attacks, police discovered a stolen van containing seven detonators and an Arabic language tape near the Atocha station. London-based newspaper Al-Qods al-Arabi received an email claiming responsibility from Abu Hafs al-Masri Brigades on the day of the attack and a videotape found at a mosque in Madrid two days later also claimed responsibility by that group. On April 3, 2004, seven key suspects committed suicide during a police raid on their Madrid apartment; among of whom was Jamal Ahmidan, a Moroccan believed to have been the central figure in the financing, planning and execution of the attacks. According to the Associated Press, it cost the perpetrators $120,000 to carry out the attacks, ranging from the cost of buying explosives to renting safe-houses. Of the 29 charged, three men were charged with murder: Jamal Zougam, a Moroccan merchant who allegedly supplied the cell phones used as detonators; Emilio Suarez Trashorras, a Spaniard accused of supplying the dynamite; and Abdelmajid Bouchar, a Moroccan. Rabei Osman, an Egyptian who claimed that the attacks were his idea, is among three other men accused of conspiracy to commit murder.","\"\"\"Timeline of Events in Madrid Train Bombings","\"\" Agence France Presse",February 14,"2007.\"","\"\"\"Madrid Attacks Timeline","\"\" BBC Online",March 12,"2004.\"","Daniel Woolls, �Judge Indicts 29 People over Madrid Terror Bombings that Killed 191 People,� Associated Press, April 12, 2006."
