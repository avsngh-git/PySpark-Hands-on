The Mayor was not there but his driver was one of the serious injuries taken to area hospitals, along with many victims who were city hall employees. Some witnesses say, however, that the attack stemmed from a fight that had taken place at the scene earlier, perhaps related to drug trafficking. --The town is a notorious transit point for drug trafficking, and is among the backdrop where brutal cartels battle for control of the cocaine, heroin and marijuana trade. This attack was among much violence in the state of Guerrero against policemen, business people, lawyers, taxi drivers, and government employees around this Easter holiday and since 2003 due to cartel conflict.
