He then moved from his Belfast home to a cottage near the village of Glenties in County Donegal to go into hiding because the IRA's punishment for informing is death. --The IRA and Sinn F�in denied involvement in the murder. On April 8, Donaldson was buried at Belfast City Cemetery instead of Milltown Cemetery, a symbol of Irish republicanism, and was perceived as a final snub by the republican movement. --A year later, senior Garda� stated that the murder may have been an accidental result of a botched kidnapping operation by an IRA gang to extract information about Donaldson's work with the British.
