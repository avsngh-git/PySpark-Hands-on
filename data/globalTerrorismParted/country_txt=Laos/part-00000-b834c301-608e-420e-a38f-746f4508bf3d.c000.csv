Lao authorities speaking off-record have blamed ethnic Hmong insurgents for the attack. Officially, however, authorities blamed bandits, indicating that private property of the tourists were stolen. One local Lao official, however, claimed that no property was stolen during the attack, and that it was a terrorist attack.
