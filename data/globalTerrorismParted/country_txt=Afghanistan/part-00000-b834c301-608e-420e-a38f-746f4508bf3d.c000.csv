The foreigners included a US national, a Filipina employee and a 39-year-old Norwegian photographer. There were four included in the attack one of whom is named Humayun. Police arrested Humayun in eastern Afghanistan on Tuesday as he was trying to flee to Pakistan. He is accused of supplying the three other attackers with weapons, explosives and suicide vests as well as transportation to the hotel. The gunmen used Kalashnikovs as their weapons. Two of the attackers, Farouq and Salahuddin, were suicide bombers. One blew up in the hotel lobby. The other, for reasons unknown, decided not to trigger himself. One attacker's suicide vest was triggered when a guard shot and killed him at the hotel's parking lot gate. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahed claimed the attack was supposed to coincide with a visit by Norwegian Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere and send a message. However, the minister was unharmed.
