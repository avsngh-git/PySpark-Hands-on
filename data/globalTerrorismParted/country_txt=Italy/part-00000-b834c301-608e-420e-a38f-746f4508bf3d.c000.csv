The blast was powerful, suggesting a high-powered explosive was used in the attack.  This incident was seen as linked to another church bomb blast at Villanova di Camposampiero church at 11:30PM on 02/08/2003.  Italian newspaper La Stampa reported that on the morning of 02/08/2003, Venice newspaper Gazzettino received a call that warned, albeit cryptically, of the impending incidents.  Moreover, a note was left at Padua city's cathedral on the morning of 02/09/2003 that rambled about bombs and churches.  It was not clear if the note was written on part of the perpetrators or a hoax.  Though Moroccan Islamists were suspected of perpetrating the incident early on, the Verona Public Prosecutor soon ruled out Islamist involvement, and was inclined to rule out leftist radicals as well.
