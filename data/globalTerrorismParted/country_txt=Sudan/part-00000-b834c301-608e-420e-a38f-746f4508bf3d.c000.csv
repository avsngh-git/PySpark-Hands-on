This was unclear however, as one of the sources notes that all of the hijackers were thought to have failed pilot training and were sent to Bahr Dar University, where they were failing their classes.  Berhanu Tegegne and Adedaw Walle were thought to be the leaders of the hijackers, and Bagemberman Tebegne was the hijackers who made the claim about the hijackers wanting everyone to see how bad conditions were in Ethiopia.  The plane was carrying Ethiopian soldiers, as well as women, children, and the elderly.  They claimed that many people got sick on the plane while negotiations went on in Khartoum, as the interior was very hot.  According to one of the sources, one of the crew members supposedly escaped from the plane and let authorities know the hijackers were armed.  After Sudanese officials negotiated for asylum for the hijackers, they claimed they would be willing to work with the Ethiopian government to extradite the hijackers back to Ethiopia, where they had the death penalty for hijackers.","\"Mohammed Ali Saeed, \"\"Ethiopian plane is hijacked and lands in Khartoum: airport","\"\" Agence France-Presse",April 26,"2001.\"","\"Asha Suleiman Braima, \"\"Ethiopian hijackers free hostages in Sudan after assurances they won't be sent home","\"\" Associated Press",April 27,"2001.\"","\"Tsegaye Tadesse, \"\"Pilot says hijackers threatened to blow up the plane"
