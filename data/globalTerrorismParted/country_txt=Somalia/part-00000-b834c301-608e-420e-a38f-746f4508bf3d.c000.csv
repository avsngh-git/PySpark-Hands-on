After being captured, the South Korean vessel issued a distress call that was picked up by a Dutch military ship operating in nearby waters, which immediately prompted a joint search and rescue operation with the U.S. Navy. The warships tried to rescue the ship but withdrew after the Somali pirates threatened to kill the crew. --The ship's captain, Choi Sung-sik, contacted Busan's office by radio and had indicated 8 armed insurgents had hijacked the ship. --Dongwon planned to contact a former insurgent leader who is currently the vice minister of harbor traffic in Somalia's transitional government. The first round of negotiations took place near the Somali port of Obbia, where the ship and its crew are believed to have been taken. A Somali national represented the Korean company in the talks. South Korea's foreign ministry later asserted on April 7 that the hijackers seemed to be affiliated with a Somali warlord named 'Somalia Marine.' --On July 29, a settlement was reached with Somali pirates and they agreed to release the hostages unharmed for a ransom. The vessel was escorted by a U.S. warship to the embassy in Kenya. The Associated Press said that $800,000 was paid for the ransom, according to a Somali militia commander, but the South Korean government refused to confirm the report, only saying it was reduced from $1 million.","\"�South Korea Tries to Identify \"\"Hijackers\"\" of Fishing Ship off Somali Coast",� Yonhap news agency,Seoul,in English,April 05,"2006.\"","Lim, Bo-mi, �Militants who seize SKorea ship off Somalia say they're defending against illegal fishing,� Associated Press Worldstream, April 05, 2006.","Carpenter, Christopher, �117-Day Ordeal Ends for Korean Fishermen,� Korea Times, July 31, 2006.",CETIS
