He asked levy personnel, who comprise of local people, not to provide shelter to the army and FC personnel.

The operator recommended that after the landmine blast the construction team had to vacate the area in emergency and the site was left unattended. Several companies were contracted to drill at Tangna Pusht-1, and 40% of the work was done at the time of the attack, but the security contract was cancelled and compensation was to be paid to the families of the levy security personnel killed.","�Troops among 10 killed in Bolan, Kohlu blasts,� The Nation (Pakistan), April 02, 2006.","�ROUNDUP: Nine killed, 11 wounded in blasts in south-western Pakistan,� Deutsche Presse-Agentur, April 02, 2006.","Rana, Arif, �Chinese Drilling Firms Asked Not to Work in Balochistan,� Business Recorder, April 04, 2006.",CETIS,0,0,0,0,""

Prominent religious personalities, including Tehrik Awam Ahli-Sunnat chief Haji Mohammad Hanif Billo, Itikhar Bhatti, Abbas Qadri, Akram Qadri and Hafiz Mohammd Taqi, died in the blast. Investigators were looking into the fact that there might have been two suicide bombers or if the bomb was remote control, and later decided it was a suicide attack. --Soon after Tuesday's bombing, violence erupted in nearby southern areas of Karachi, where support runs high for Tehrik, Karachi's largest Sunni Muslim religious group, which had grieved that not enough security had been provided to their leaders and whose head died in this incident, as groups of youths burned at least three gas stations, buses, a fire truck, police van and ambulance. Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal [MMA] chief Qazi Hussain Ahmed blamed the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), which had killed Sunni Tehrik leaders in the past. Suspicions as to who was behind the attack varied greatly, and the attack gained attention and comment around the world. --A three day mourning period afterwards was declared, which affected daily business. -- On 06/15/07, the Sindh Home Department identified Lashkar-e Jhangvi as the network behind the attack and Mohammad Siddiq as the bomber by matching the DNA taken from his head with that of his brother. Of the six remaining suspects involved, Mohammad Amin and Sultan were already in custody for the Allama Hasan Turabi murder case, and Mufti Zakir and Rehmatullah were arrested on June 15. The Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) issued non-bailable warrants of absconding accused against the other three on July 26. On 07/13/07, the case went to trial at the ATC under charges of sections of PPC, Explosive Substance Act, and the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997.
